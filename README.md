# Description

HTML5 â€“ a developer perspective
Posted on April 15, 2013 by Anders Lybecker 

CopenhagenJS and CNUG presents Rasmus Erik.

### Abstract

HTML5/JavaScript is the widest deployed client application platform.
First, we start out with a helicopter view of the state of the APIs
from a developer perspective to get a taste of the platform. Then, in
the second part we dive in and take a look at the actual code, by
touching on some concrete examples using different parts of the APIs.
